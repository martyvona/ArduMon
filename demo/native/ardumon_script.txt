# ardumon_client text script
#
# blank lines as well as comment lines starting with # are ignored
# lines may end with any combination of newline and carriage reuturn (other trailing whitespace is not ignored)
#
# lines not starting with > are sent as newline terminated commands
# leading whitespace on command lines will be ignored 
# to send a command starting with > or ? prefix it with at least one space
#
# lines starting with > are expected response lines (expected to be terminated with carriage return / newline pairs)
#
# lines starting ?[ms] wait for the specified amount of time (default 100ms) and then discard all received input
# the default wait time can be overriden with ardumon_client --auto_wait
# the --auto_wait option also causes a ? line to be inferred after each command line with no subsequent > line
#
# ardumon_client will parse this entire script and store it in memory at program start before issuing the first command
# so it is not currently possible to use ardumon_client with extremely long scripts that wouldn't fit in memory
# or with piped input that does not terminate with an EOF in finite time
